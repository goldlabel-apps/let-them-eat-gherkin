### Context

Will you win friends and influence people with Gherkin? Why not? 
All the cool kids are doing it.

A business stakeholder comes over and asks you to develop something.  
"Certainly" says you...  "That's my job after all. 
What EXACTLY do you want me to build?"  
And that's where the problems start.
