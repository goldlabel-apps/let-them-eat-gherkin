### Setting Context

Here is a different perspective on e2e. One which is close to my heart; making my job as a 
developer easier. As a developer I create software for all kinds of business 
stakeholders from micro-managing small business owners to large, complex corporate 
political heirachies to highly technical CTOs.

### Meet Bob.

Let's look at a pretend real life example. This actually came from a 
[technical test](./tech_test.html) I did recently when applying for a new role. 
_You guys know those technical tests, right?_.

So Bob has been tasked to create an App which can be used to score a Tennis tournament your 
company is running next month. He shows up at your desk to delegate that task to you. Because 
it's your job, right?

Let's look at how that process could go from here. For that we'll open the 
Let them eat Gherkin React App. The source is available on Github. I encourage you to 
raise any issues you spot, submit Pull Resquests.... get involvesd. It makes me look good 
and it adds your Github profile, which is important in the current recruitment climate.
